Good question :)

Had a long search in my mail archives and found the following:

:)  Guess you found out there is no documentation on that :)


First get two teams...  best is to have the players themselves
form the team and appoint a team captain for each team.

After that you will have two lists with email addreses.
You add them in the .glx file and above the first
list you add

  team 0

and before the second list you add

  team 1


At the top of the .glx file you add

  teamgame

and then depending on the number of players there are:

  rows 10
  colums 10

(in this case the game would have 100 players).

You then run the create command and the game is ready.
With 
  ./galaxyng -teaminfo  game  turn  team_number
you can create a special report for each of the team captains.


All very simple :)  except...   depending on the number of
players you will have to edit the creategame.c file.

The galaxy that is created looks something like:

   t0   t1   t0  ...  t1   t0   t1 

   t1   t0   t1  ...  t0   t1   t1 
         .            .
         .            .
         .            .
   t0   t1   t0  ...  t1   t0   t1 

   t1   t0   t1  ...  t0   t1   t1 

Where t0 is the home planet of a team 0 player and  t1 is
the home planet of a team 1 player.  (That way each team
player is surrounded by an equal amount of allies and enemies).

The number of rows and colums is defined in the .glx file.

However  rows x colums  must be equal to the number of players
that join. And in some case this gives odd results.

For instance if  16 players join  the galaxy
will be  4 by 4.    However if  14 player join the galaxy will
be 2 x 7   which will look very odd.    
This can be solved by using a bigger number of row and colums
and removing some of the planets  (I did that for Tiger3).

For instance  for the 14 player one, you can make it
4 by 4 and remove 2 planets:  

   
        t1   t0   t1 

   t1   t0   t1   t0 

   t0   t1   t0   t1 

   t1   t0   t1      


You can find out how this is done in
createCheckeredLayout()...  it is currently setup for
a 7 by 7 grid and the removed of the corner players and
4 players in the middle...

Have fun,
Frans.

 			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
 			
				<p>The two basic items to host a game are a Linux box and an internet connection. GalaxyNG should compile and run right out of the box on Linux. This software is required:</p>
<pre>C (gcc) compiler; to compile the server 
crontab; to automatically run turns at a given time 
procmail; to automatically process incoming orders</pre>
				<p>The GalaxyNG server is command line based, so you don't need X-windows. It requires little memory and even runs on a 2 MB Amiga. Depending on the mumber of players and planets, you need up to 20 MB of disk space per game. It isn't so much that the GalaxyNG server large but that the data files can become quite large. For instance, turn reports with the battleprotocol option enabled can be 500 KB. So if there are 30 players left, this would amount to 15 MB of disk space just to store the reports before they are sent. In these times of GB hard disks this should not be a problem though :)</p>
				<p>It isn't that difficult to start up your own game. It takes a while to configure the server and set up a game, but once it runs it needs pratically no time at all. The whole process is automated, except for a possible bug fix or answering questions. Before you run a game you should make sure you have enough time and a connection to the internet for at least one year, since games can run that long. If you start a game, please continue it to the end, as it is very frustrating for players if a game just ends somewhere in the middle without comming to a conclusion.</p>

			<hr />
 			
			<h2 id="compile">Compilation</h2>
				<p>To extract the code, run:</p>
<pre>tar -xvzf galaxy-#.tar.gz</pre>
				<p>This creates the directory <tt>NG/</tt>.</p>		
				<p>Most of the configuration is done after compilation and is handled by the program <tt>NG/install.sh</tt>.  Before compiling the GalaxyNG server you should review <tt>NG/Source/makefile</tt> to make sure it fit your computer's configuration.  The following variables can be configured:</p>
<pre>CC     = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -pedantic -g 
LIBS   = -lm</pre>
				<p>The above settings are valid for most systems that have <tt>GCC</tt> installed. They have been tested on Debian, Slackware, SuSE, and RedHat systems and should compile without changes on most Linux boxes.  Do not add any optimization options - otherwise the code will not function properly! The server only runs a couple of times per week, so speed is not an issue.</p>
				<p>To compile the code, in the <tt>NG/</tt> directory run:</p>
<pre>make</pre>
				<p>This creates the executable <tt>NG/Source/galaxyng</tt>.</p> 

			<hr />

			<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>
				<p>To install the GalaxyNG server, in the <tt>NG/</tt> directory run:</p>
<pre>make install</pre>
				<p>It creates <tt>$HOME/Games</tt> and installs a number of files in it.</p>
				<p>To install the GalaxyNG server in a different directory, you must edit the first line of <tt>NG/install.sh</tt>.  You also <strong>must</strong> set the environment variable <tt>GALAXYNGHOME</tt> to this directory.  You can do this by adding a line to your <tt>.bash_profile</tt> file (or the appropriate file for your favourite shell).  For instance, if you have installed the GalaxyNG server in <tt>/home/gng/mygames</tt>, add:</p>
<pre>export GALAXYNGHOME=/home/gng/mygames</pre>

			<h2 id="config">Configuration</h2>
				<p>The server is configured with a <tt>.galaxyngrc</tt> file. The server looks for this file in the directory <tt>$HOME/Games/</tt>. It also looks for the file in <tt>$HOME/Games/data/&lt;game name&gt;/</tt>, whcih overrides the global settings for that particular game. A documented <tt>.galaxyngrc</tt> file can be found in the <tt>Doc/</tt> directory. You can use it to specify the following parameters:</p>

(It treats the last digit of the time as a wild card, so specifying 13:05 would have the same effect.)</td>

			<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
				<p>Running a galaxy game consists of steps:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>register players,</li>
					<li>create a new game,</li>
					<li>mail the turn 0 report,</li>
					<li>check and store the orders that the players sent in,</li>
					<li>run a turn,</li>
					<li>mail the turn reports.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Then repeat steps 4, 5, and 6 until the players request the game be stopped.</p>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="util">Utilities</h2>
				<p>Registering players, checking orders and running turns are, of course, very cumbersome processes that are best automated with <tt><a href="http://www.procmail.org/">procmail</a></tt>, <tt><a href="http://www.wlug.org.nz/formail(1)">formail</a></tt> and <tt><a href="http://www.wlug.org.nz/cron(8)">cron</a></tt>.</p>
				<p>If you have never used <tt>procmail</tt> before, read the <a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/qs/">Procmail Quick Start</a> and review the example Procmail configuration file in <tt>$HOME/Games/procmailrc</tt> carefully.  If procmail is misconfigured, <em>you could lose or bounce your email</em>.  <tt>Procmail</tt> can be difficult to get working.  On some systems <tt>procmail</tt> works by just creating a <tt>.procmailrc</tt> file in your home directory.  On other systems you have to create a <tt>.forward</tt> file, that contains <tt>| /usr/bin/procmail</tt> to get <tt>procmail</tt> to work.  The Procmail Quick Start also discusses additional configuration needed to support <a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/qs/#maildirDetails">maildir delivery</a> and/or <a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/qs/#qmail">qmail</a>.</p>
				<p>Each entry in <tt>.procmailrc</tt> defines a recipe that tells what has to be done to a message and under what condition. The recipe for order messages is:</p>
<pre>:0 rw :orders
* ^Subject:.*order
|/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s $HOME/Games/galaxyng -check</pre>
				<p>Translated it means: if the subject of the message contains the string "order", pipe the message to <tt>formail</tt>. It is case insensitive, so order, NewOrder and ORDERS will all match the condistion. A lock file with the name orders.lock is used to prevent the simultaneous execution of the same recipe if two or more messages arrive at the same time.  There are similar entries for the commands to request a copy of a turn report, relay messages to other players and register for games. You will find them in the example procmailrc file at <tt>$HOME/Games/procmailrc</tt>.</p>
				<p><tt>formail</tt> reformats email messages. When used with the <tt>-rkbt</tt> flags, all mail header lines are thrown away, a <tt>To:</tt> line is generated with the address of person that sent the message, a <tt>Subject:</tt> line is generated, with the original subject prepended with <tt>Re:</tt>, and the body of the message is retained.  This allows the GalaxyNG server to mail forecasts, turn reports and other responses to the person who sent the message.</p>
				<p><tt>cron</tt> runs programs on a schedule.  You can use cron to send <a href="#due">orders due</a> messages and <a href="#run">run turns</a>.</p>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="are">Automatic Registration Engine</h2>
				<p>The Automatic Registration Engine (ARE) is invoked by procmail to respond to emails from players signing up for games.  For example, to allow up to 25 players to sign up for a game named Jangi, use this procmail recipe:</p>
<pre>:0 rw :Jangi.lock
* ^Subject.*Join Jangi
|/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s $HOME/Games/are Jangi 25 0 0 0 | /usr/sbin/sendmail -t</pre>
				<p>Up to 25 people could register for Jangi by sending an email to the server with the subject "Join Jangi."</p>
				<p>You can also let players specify the number and sizes of their homeworlds, with these parameters: <tt>&lt;total planet size&gt; &lt;maximum planet size&gt; &lt;maximum number of planets&gt;</tt>. For example, to allow 10 players to sign up for a game named Welland with 2,500 production on up to 5 planets, with no planet larger than 1,000 production, use this procmail recipe:</p>
<pre>:0 rw :Welland.lock
* ^Subject.*Join Welland
|/usr/bin/formail -rkbt -s $HOME/Games/are Welland 10 2500 1000 5 | /usr/sbin/sendmail -t</pre>
				<p>Players can request planet sizes by adding this line to their registration email:</p>
<pre>#PLANETS &lt;size of planet 1&gt; &lt;size of planet 2&gt; ... &lt;size of planet n&gt;
e.g. #PLANETS 1000 500 500 250 250</pre>
				<p>The server will send error messages to players who submit requests for planets that do not match the criteria specified in the <tt>.procmail</tt> recipe.</p>
				<p>Note that better examples of game signup recipes can be found in the file <tt>$HOME/Games/procmailrc</tt>.</p>
				<p>The email address and planet sizes are written to two files: <tt>$HOME/Games/&lt;game name&gt;.players</tt> for players that were accepted and <tt>$HOME/Games/&lt;game name&gt;.standby</tt> for players that were rejected. The contents of these files can be pasted into your .glx file.</p>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="create">Creating a New Game</h2>
				<p>The game configuration file specifies the structure of the galaxy: number of home, empty, and stuff planets; size and name of the galaxy; the email address of each of the players; and some game options.  Create a template game configuration file by using the <tt>-template</tt> command.</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -template &lt;game name&gt; &lt;number of players&gt;</pre>
				<p>This creates a file named <tt>&lt;game name&gt;.glx</tt> with default values for all parameters, plus documentation about what each parameter does.  Edit this file to insert the email addresses of the players and make any desired changes to the configuration. For example, if you have eight players and you want to call the game Orion, you can create the game as follows:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -template Orion 8</pre>
				<p>The template should be edited to change the dummy email addresses to the real email addresses of the players and make changes to configuration options, if desired.  The game is then created by running:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -create &lt;game name&gt;</pre>
				<p>So, for the Orion game, run:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -create Orion.glx</pre>
				<p>The server gives a detailed list of what it is doing and what planets are created. When the game is created a map is printed.  A lot of output is created so you might want to redirect the output of the server to some file, say <tt>OrionLayout.txt</tt>:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -create Orion.glx  &gt; OrionLayout.txt</pre>
				<p>To create the turn 0 score, first create a directory for it:</p>
<pre>mkdir &lt;web directory&gt;/&lt;game name&gt;</pre>
				<p>and then create the score:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -score &lt;game name&gt; &gt; &lt;web directory&gt;/&lt;game name&gt;/score.html</pre>
				<p>So, for the Orion game, run:</p>
<pre>mkdir &lt;web directory&gt;/Orion
./galaxyng -score Orion > &lt;web directory&gt;/Orion/score.html</pre>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="mail">Mailing the Turn 0 Reports</h2>
				<p>If you are happy with the galaxy you created, you can mail the turn 0 reports with:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -mail0 &lt;game name&gt;</pre>
				<p>Before you start any real games you might want to try to run a couple of test games with yourself as player. This way you can see if everything works OK.</p>
				<p>So:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -mail0 Orion</pre>
				<p>for your Orion game.</p>
			<hr />

			<h2 id="process">Processing Orders</h2>
				<p>When you receive orders from a player, you can store and check them with the following command:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -check &lt; &lt;file with orders&gt;</pre>
				<p>The file with orders has to be a properly formatted email message, with a To: field and a Subject: field with the word "orders" in it.</p>
				<p>The orders are stored in the directory <tt>orders/&lt;game name&gt;</tt> and the program sends a forecast to the player. A log file is kept of all orders that are checked. It can be found at <tt>$HOME/Games/log/orders_processed.txt</tt>.</p>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="due">Sending Orders Due Mesages</h2>

				<p>Players that haven't sent orders can be reminded with an orders due message.  You do this with:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -due &lt;game name&gt;</pre>
				<p>For example:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -due Orion</pre>

			<hr />

			<h2 id="run">Running Turns</h2>
				<p>When it is time to run a turn you do this with:</p>
<pre>./run_game &lt;game name&gt;</pre>
				<p>This shell script collects all orders in one file, runs the turn based on these orders, and then sends out all the turn reports to the players.  It also creates high-score lists in HTML and places it in your <tt>$HOME/public_html</tt> directory, if you have one.  You can edit the script and add other commands that need to be run for each turn.</p>
				<p>After each turn you are sent a GM status report. It tells you whether the turn ran successfully. It is especially handy if the server runs on some remote computer. It also contains information on the status of all nations in the game, a list of all bombings and a map. That way you can follow the game.</p>
				<p>If for some reason there was a problem with a turn, you can rerun it by executing:</p>
<pre>./run_game &lt;game name&gt; &lt;turn&gt;</pre>
				<p>The game will be rerun and new turn reports are sent to the players.  This only works for turns that already ran.</p>
				<p>Although it is simple to run a turn it becomes cumbersome after a few turns. Automization is again the solution. You can do this with cron. For instance if you have a game called Orion, that runs on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday around 21:15 hours and send reminders at 17:15 hours, you can use the following cron file:</p>
<pre>#           days             days 
#  Min Hour of     months    of     Command to run
#           month           week
    15   21   *      *     1,3,5     /home/username/Games/run_game Orion
    15   17   *      *     1,3,5     /home/username/Games/galaxyng -due Orion</pre>
				<p>To enable a cron file run:</p>
<pre>crontab &lt;your cron file&gt;</pre>
				<p>To see what cron files you have enabled run:</p>
<pre>crontab -l</pre>
				<p>An example file can be found at <tt>$HOME/GalaxyNG/games.crontab</tt></p>
				<p>See the <tt>crontab</tt> and <tt>cron</tt> manual for more information.</p>

			<h2 id="host">Hosting Team Games</h2>
				<p>First get two teams...  best is to have the players themselves form the team and appoint a team captain for each team.  After that you will have two lists with email addresses. You add them in the .glx file and above the first list you add:</p>
<pre>team 0</pre>
				<p>and before the second list you add:</p>
<pre>team 1</pre>
				<p>At the top of the .glx file you add:</p>
<pre>teamgame</pre>
				<p>and then depending on the number of players there are:</p>
<pre>rows 10
colums 10</pre>
				<p>(in this case the game would have 100 players).  You then run the create command and the game is ready.  You can create a special report for each of the team captains with:</p>
<pre>./galaxyng -teaminfo  game  turn  team_number</pre>
				<p>All very simple :)  except...   depending on the number of players you will have to edit the creategame.c file. The galaxy that is created looks something like:</p>
<pre>t0   t1   t0  ...  t1   t0   t1 

t1   t0   t1  ...  t0   t1   t1 
      .            .
      .            .
      .            .
t0   t1   t0  ...  t1   t0   t1 

t1   t0   t1  ...  t0   t1   t1</pre>
				<p>Where t0 is the home planet of a team 0 player and t1 is the home planet of a team 1 player.  (That way each team player is surrounded by an equal amount of allies and enemies).</p>
				<p>The number of rows and colums is defined in the .glx file. However, rows x colums must be equal to the number of players that join. And in some case this gives odd results. For instance if  16 players join  the galaxy will be  4 by 4.  However if  14 player join the galaxy will be 2 x 7   which will look very odd. This can be solved by using a bigger number of row and colums and removing some of the planets  (I did that for Tiger3). For instance for the 14 player one, you can make it
4 by 4 and remove 2 planets:</p>
<pre>t1   t0   t1

; This is an example configuration file for the server.  To use it
; copy it as .galaxyngrc into the Games/ directory.
;
; The parameters defined in this file are used each time a game runs.
; You can override these defaults for a specific game by copying the
; file to Games/Data/<game name>/.galaxyngrc and then modifying it.
;
; The parameters names are not case sensitve. 
; You can use a ";" as a comment marker.

;
; GMemail defines the email address of the GM. 
; A status report is send to this address each time a game is run.
; If you do not want the report comment the line out.
;

GMemail galaxyng@localdomain

;
; The command used to send an turn report. The turn report is piped into
; the command. Use { } around the command if it contains any spaces.
; 

sendmail {/usr/sbin/sendmail -t }

;
; The following two command are needed for option COMPRESS, 
; which causes turn reports to be compressed and encoded 
; before they are emailed.
;
; For both commands data should come in via standard input, 
; and output should go to standard output.
;

encode {/usr/bin/mmencode }
compress { /usr/bin/zip }

; 
; Full bombing, when bombed planets are completely bombed.
; All population, industry, capital, colonists, and materials are gone.
; Normally the population and industry is reduced to 25% of it's
; original value.
;
; Uncommend if you want this option.

;fullbombing

;
; Don't remove idle nations from a game.  
; Normaly if players do not send in orders for a couple of turns
; their nation self destructs.
;
; Uncommend if you want this option.

;DontDropDead

;
; On some systems cron behaves a bit odd after a system reset,
; and re-runs many old cron jobs. You can use the following option
; to protect against this.  The server will refuse to run a turn if
; the current time is not almost equal to the time you specified here.

;StartTime 13:00

; In this case the server would only run a turn if the current time
; is between 13:00 and 13:09.   (It treats the last digit of the
; time as a wild card, so specifying 13:05 would have had the same 
; effect.)

; 
; Sometimes, if you have enough disk space, it is nice to get a copy
; of turn reports that are send out to the players.
; If you uncommend the following parameter, a copy of each turn report
; that is send out is stored in reports/<game name>/
